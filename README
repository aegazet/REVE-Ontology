REVE Ontology aims at describing students, courses, publications and researchers at Eurecom.
The ontology is used to build within the data.eurecom.fr initiative.

This version is 1.0.

To edit the schema, clone the repository, make your changes, check to make sure your change results in a valid file.

If you are satisfied with your edits, send me a pull request (http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) I'll consider merging and publishing it later.
